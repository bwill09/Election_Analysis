4. calculate the precentage of votes each candidate won.

    ## Challenge Overview 
    
    There were some glitiches installing Python3 and patches. Writing the election analysis script code in Visual Studio at some instances wouldn't work
    due to indentation inconsistency. My code counldn't fire up when I try to determine winning vote count, winning percentage, and winning candidate
    because there weren't defined or initilized.
    
    ## Challenge Summary 
    Python glitch was sorted out with extra research source shared by AskBCS Learning Assistant. I debugged to resolve the indentation issues. 
    I had received help from AskBCS with similar value initialization on previous project so I referenced that, and I worked.
